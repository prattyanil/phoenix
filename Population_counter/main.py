'''
Members of a population are represented as a collection of lifespans. Each lifespan represents a year of birth and, if the individual has died, a year of death.
write a function or method that takes the above information and returns every year in which the population was lower than the preceding year.


The solution has been implemented using Python Programming language and uses nested list to read the input data, builds a dictionary with population count for 
each year and then prints the year where population was lower than the previous year
